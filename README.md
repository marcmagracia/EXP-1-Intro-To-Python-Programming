## Experiment 1: Introduction to Python Programming

This repository is designed to show my progress in Python programming. Through a number of exercises and projects, I am expected to identify the basic codes and functions in Python Programming and to be able to apply the different codes and functions in creating a Python program.

-----

#### Instructions: 
Write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. 

-----

#### Problem 1: ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order. 

Example: 
  - alphabet_soup(“hello”)
    - _Expected output:_ ehllo 
  - alphabet_soup(“hacker”) ➞ acehkr
    - _Expected output:_ ehllo 

-----

#### Problem 2: EMOTICON PROBLEM
Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:

  - Smile  =  :)
  - Grin   =  :D
  - Sad    =  :((
  - Mad    = >:(

Example: 
  - emotify(“Make me smile”) 
    -_Expected output:_ Make me :) 
  - emotify(“I am mad”) 
    -_Expected output:_ I am >:(

-----

###### Problem 3: UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM 
Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables. 

Example:  lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
  _Expected output:_
    - first: 1  
    - middle: [2,3,4,5] 
    - last: 6
