## Experiment 1: Introduction to Python Programming

_This is the first of several repositories I will upload to document my progress in Python programming through several exercises I am and will be performing. In this project, I am expected to identify the basic codes and functions in Python programming and to be able to apply the different codes and functions when creating a Python program._

## Given problems and their expected outputs:

#### ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order. 
Example: 
  - alphabet_soup(“hello”)
    - _Expected output:_ ehllo 
  - alphabet_soup(“hacker”) ➞ acehkr
    - _Expected output:_ ehllo 
-----

#### EMOTICON PROBLEM: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. 

Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:
  - Smile  =  :)
  - Grin   =  :D
  - Sad    =  :((
  - Mad    = >:(

Example: 
  - emotify(“Make me smile”) 
    - _Expected output:_ Make me :) 
  - emotify(“I am mad”) 
    - _Expected output:_ I am >:(
-----

#### UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM: Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables. 

Example:  lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 

- _Expected output:_
  - first: 1
  - middle: [2,3,4,5]
  - last: 6
